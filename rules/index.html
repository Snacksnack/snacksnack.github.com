		<div class="code-wrapper" style="white-space:pre;padding:10px">1) Before asking any questions related to ricing, you should read the /w/ pastebin, available at http://pastebin.com/W0SsUtEH
		 
2) No circlejerking spam, this includes clopping and yiffing.
		
3) Don't be rude to other users, this includes shitposting.    
		
4) We're not "rice" support. We'd love to help you, but you also need to do some research on your own, we won't spoon-feed you everything.
		 
5) You'll get two warnings before being banned. You may appeal this ban with the mod that banned you.</div>
